        <li>Creating a pipeline</li>
        <li>Installing and running Docker on the instance</li>
        <li>Creating a Dockerfile</li>
        <li>Building a Docker image</li>

    <h4>Update 25 Feb 2023</h4>
    <p>
      A lot of things happened in the last 2 days.
      <br />
      I'm still learning, but I'm getting there. I had 2 old PCs. I installed
      Fedora server on both, and enabled ssh. They're currently running on my
      desk, and I'm using them as servers.
      <br />
      I installed Jenkins and Docker on one of them, and I'm using it to build
      and deploy my app.
      <br />
      So far I learned how to how to use Jenkins to build an image of my app.
      <br />
      The exiting part is that the image uses a custom image as a base. The
      custom image includes all the dependencies that my app needs to run. This
      should make the build process faster. And the even more exiting part is
      that I'm using Jenkins to build the update the base image whenever it's
      changed;

      <br />
      All this in a multi-branch pipeline.

      <br />

      The next step is to use my other pc to get the built image from the registry and run it as a container.

      That is easy, but it must be automated. And for some reason I don't want to connect to the other pc with Jenkins.
      <br>
      It just feels wrong. 
      I must automate this on the second PC.

    button.addEventListener("click", () => {
      fetch("/hello")
        .then((res) => res.text())
        .then((data) => alert(`Response from server: ${data}`));
    });
